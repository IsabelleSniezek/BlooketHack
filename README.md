# BlooketHack
Go into HackGUI and copy all text. Create a bookmark and edit it and enter the text you copied into the address URL. Press save and once in a blooket game, open the bookmark to access the menu.
OR
If the bookmark doesn't work, paste the text into console. You can access console by using Ctrl+Shift+J
Note: I recommend using Prevent Suspension when you're going to hack a game.
